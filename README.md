New website following good practise.
I used cookiecutter to start the project to see how to structure it "correctly"

I thought about using multiple databases (One for the whole app and the other for the information about companies) but I can't see the advantage and in other hand there are disadvantages, I couldn't use the relations between ETF and Companies (for example). So I've decided to go with only one database. In the worst case and the webapp became a world success I will split the databases.
